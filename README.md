This is a pet project where I was practicing the usage of Selemium framework ( Java ) to
conduct the UI Testing of the web site https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

This project has been completed as part of course at Test Automation University.

In this project I used Page Object Model and separated the tests based on the functionality.
